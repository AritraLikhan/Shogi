- ✅ **Manual Input Support**: USI notation for drops (e.g., "P*5e")

### 2. AI Engine (`shogi_ai.py`)
- ✅ **Minimax Algorithm** with Alpha-Beta pruning
- ✅ **Iterative Deepening** for better time management
- ✅ **Transposition Table** for position caching
- ✅ **Move Ordering** (captures and promotions first)
- ✅ **Positional Evaluation** with piece values and board control
- ✅ **Multiple Difficulty Levels** (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert)

### 2. GUI Enhancements (`shogi_gui_enhanced.py`)
- ✅ **Game Mode Selection** (Human vs AI, Human vs Human)
- ✅ **AI Difficulty Control** with real-time adjustment
- ✅ **Turn Indicators** showing whose turn it is
- ✅ **AI Thinking Indicator** during move calculation
- ✅ **Threaded AI Moves** to prevent GUI freezing
- ✅ **Enhanced Move Validation** for AI mode

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- ✅ **Alpha-Beta Pruning** reduces search space significantly
- ✅ **Move Ordering** improves pruning efficiency
- ✅ **Time Management** ensures responsive gameplay
- ✅ **Position Caching** avoids redundant calculations
- ✅ **Iterative Deepening** provides best move within time limit

## Technical Specifications

### AI Performance:
- **Easy Mode**: ~30-100 nodes, 2s time limit
- **Medium Mode**: ~60-200 nodes, 3s time limit
- **Hard Mode**: ~90-500 nodes, 5s time limit
- **Expert Mode**: ~120-1000+ nodes, 8s time limit

### Evaluation Function:
- Material values (Pawn=1, Gold=6, King=1000, etc.)
- Positional values for different piece types
- King safety evaluation
- Center control assessment
- Pieces in hand consideration
- Checkmate/stalemate detection

### Search Algorithm:
```python
def minimax(board, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player):
    # Terminal conditions
    if depth == 0 or game_over:
        return evaluate_position(board)
    
    # Alpha-beta pruning with move ordering
    for move in ordered_moves:
        board.push(move)
        eval = minimax(board, depth-1, alpha, beta, not maximizing_player)
        board.pop()
        # Update alpha/beta and check for pruning
```

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Game:
1. **AI Launcher** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   python launch_shogi_ai.py
   ```

2. **Direct GUI**:
   ```bash
   python shogi_gui_enhanced.py
   ```

3. **Test AI**:
   ```bash
   python test_ai.py
   ```


### Game Modes:
- **Human vs AI**: Play against computer opponent
- **Human vs Human**: Two players on same computer

### Controls:
- Click pieces to select, then click destination to move
- Use manual move input for USI format moves
- Adjust AI difficulty in real-time
- Toggle between Japanese and English piece symbols

## Testing Results

### AI Performance Test:
```
Testing Shogi AI...
Initial position - Turn: Black
Legal moves: 30
AI evaluated 930 nodes in 0.93s
AI suggested move: 2h4h
Move is legal: True
```

### AI vs AI Demo:
- Successfully played 20 moves in AI vs AI mode
- Average response time: 0.5-1.0 seconds per move
- Nodes evaluated: 56-990 per move depending on position complexity
- AI made reasonable strategic moves (piece development, control)

## Optimizations for Shogi Complexity

1. **Move Ordering**: Captures and promotions tried first
2. **Time Management**: Iterative deepening ensures moves within time limits
3. **Position Caching**: Transposition table avoids re-evaluation
4. **Efficient Search**: Alpha-beta pruning eliminates unnecessary branches
5. **Smart Evaluation**: Considers material, position, and tactical factors

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Opening Book**: Pre-computed opening moves
2. **Endgame Tablebase**: Perfect endgame play
3. **Machine Learning**: Neural network evaluation
4. **Advanced Search**: Quiescence search for tactics
5. **Better Evaluation**: More sophisticated positional understanding

## Dependencies

- `python-shogi`: Core shogi library
- `tkinter`: GUI framework (Python standard library)
- `threading`: For non-blocking AI moves
- `time`: Performance measurement
- `random`: Move randomization

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully provides:
- ✅ **Intelligent AI opponent** using minimax with optimizations
- ✅ **Responsive gameplay** with 1-8 second move times
- ✅ **Multiple difficulty levels** for different skill levels
- ✅ **Smooth user experience** with threaded AI moves
- ✅ **Comprehensive evaluation** considering multiple factors
- ✅ **Efficient search** handling shogi's complexity

The AI demonstrates good strategic understanding, making reasonable opening moves, piece development, and tactical decisions. The optimizations ensure the game remains playable despite shogi's large branching factor and complex position evaluation requirements.
